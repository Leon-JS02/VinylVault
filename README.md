## What is VinylVault?
VinylVault is a web-app designed to help users track and manage their music collections. 
Users can search for albums they own and add them to their personal collection. 

The app provides an analytics dashboard with insights, including breakdowns by genre, decade, and more, including tailored music suggestions driven from their library. The app uses data from the Spotify and LastFM APIs to power its ETL pipeline. 

Future updates will include integration with Discogs, allowing users to browse current listings for albums in their collection and receive additional recommendations, filtering by price and condition.
